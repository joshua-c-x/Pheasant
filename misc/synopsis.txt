potpourri narritive game/structure

an old man will slowly turn all the adults in the town into his cult; this happens over a period of 24 hours (realtime) and 1 year (gametime) (four seasons?)

during that time, the player is responsible for seeking 'knowledge points'. topics of conversation, events witnessed, or item added into inventory. -> hints generated, new situations become visible.

every one of the 12 kids has to cooperate with their unique powers to prevent the townspeople from doing horrible things.
